# Rock_Paper_Scissors



This is my first project in Javascript, and it is about making a simple
game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. The project at this stage will
be played through the browser, but without a graphical interface, which is to be
added later on when I learn more about graphical interfaces.

The project will include many challanges and will push me to learn new ways and code
to make things and get things done.
